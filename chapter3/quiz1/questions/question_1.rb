# Uncomment each line and fill in the blanks so that the arithmetic
# operations produce the correct value for each variable.  e.g. in
# `four = 2.+()`, the calculation to the right of the `=` should
# evaluate to 4. So it would become `four = 2.+(2)`.

# five = 2.+()

# seven = 14./()

# two = 2.*()./()

# three_point_zero = 6.to_f./()

# two_is_integer = 4.to_f./().to_i.integer?

# four = 12.%()

# zero = 12.%()
